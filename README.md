# Isophote Eye Center Detection

Matlab/C++ Implementation of eye center detection based on isophotes. This package also includes evaluation scripts for the BioID and Yale datasets.

## Is the code citable? (for research projects)

We have used isophote eye corner detection for some gaze/eyetracking "stuff", 
but never published it. However, we have derived isophote based saliency map
segmentation based on this code/implementation, which means that you can cite
this implementation by referring to
